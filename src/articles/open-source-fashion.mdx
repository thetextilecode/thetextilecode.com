The fashion industry is one of the most traditional and change-resistant
industries in the world. There are many challenges that come with working
in fashion, but one of the biggest is the slow pace of change. It's just how
things have always been. In a world where technology is evolving at an
ever-increasing pace, changing our everyday behaviour and how we interact
with one another, fashion can often feel like it's stuck in the past.

The fashion and textile sector also happens to be one of the biggest
polluters on the planet. And, while there are plenty of resources and tools
online to educate businesses about the ethical and environmental impacts of
the supply chain, there are few resources for learning about technology
that can help them do just that in a way thatâ€™s accessible to them. The
most common case studies and general recommendations are centred around
cost-prohibitive solutions that would result in vendor lock-in,
particularly for smaller businesses. Many times, smaller businesses simply
don't know <span className='italic'>how</span> to be more sustainable.

Free and open source software and its principals can help facilitate a more
transparent landscape in the industry, which could ultimately help to
decrease its socioeconomic and environmental impact.


### What is Open Source?

In layman's terms, open source software refers to any kind of software
where its source code is <Tooltippy tooltipText={`Free as in free speech,
not free beer.`} triggerText={`freely`}/> accessible to anyone who wishes to
view it.

Open source software is usually, though not always, free in cost. The
software's accompanying license (a file, much like [this one](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/LICENSE.txt))
determines what a user can and cannot do with the license, and this will
tend to vary.

There are many types of open source software, and it's used in a
wide range of industries. For example, the popular browser Firefox is open
source. Open source is also used in a variety of business applications, such
as the OpenOffice suite of office productivity software.

Open source doesn't just refer to software though. There is an entire
philosophy dedicated to the practice, which has been traced back to the
80s. There are [three core principles](https://opensource.com/principles)
behind open source: transparency, participation, and collaboration. As you
can see, open source principals transcend software.

What these principles mean is that the very development of the software is an
open and participatory process built on communication and trust. This allows
for improvement based on collective feedback from a wide range of people with
diverse perspectives, which can make projects more innovative, robust, and
efficient. Ever heard the phrase "it takes a village to raise a child"?
Ultimately, a community working together toward a common goal will
benefit not just the goal, but the community around it as well.

The open source model has been successful in a number of industries, helping
to drive innovation and cut costs. But the fashion industry seems to have
trailed behind. Why is that?

### A lagging industry

Historically, the fashion and textile sector has been much slower to adopt
open source as a viable option. Historically, open source was seen as
something that only smaller businesses do, but [this is quickly
changing](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/open-source-e-commerce-the-next-wave-of-value-for-the-enterprise). There is a sort of unspoken secrecy in fashion, with businesses and professionals alike tending to be more guarded about business
practices. But in the context of climate change, the opposite approach must
be taken, because transparency is tantamount to combating climate change.

### Why fashion companies should care about open source

Open source impacts you more than you think. A recent study by OpenUK found
that [89% of companies](https://openuk.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openuk-state-of-open_final-version.pdf) use open source software. Any company that uses or
depends on software should care about open source.

Cutting-edge technologies are already used in so-called "smart factories"
around the world, making production processes more efficient. Yet many of
these innovations are not shared openly. How great would it be if
businesses of all sizes could benefit from these advances?

Sometimes, though, it's not up to the company to share these advancements.
They might agree to a testimonial or interview explaining how they are
using X or Y software to be more efficient, but they can't do much more
than be a case study that will ultimately be used to sell more of the
vendor's software.

That's the nature of proprietary software. It's not meant to be shared and
built upon in the open, it's meant to be consumed. But this kind of "to each
their own" mentality isn't going to cut it.

In order to be more sustainable, we need to work together and share
more. Share processes, practices, innovations. Because at the end of the
day, you're not selling software. You shouldn't be scared to share these
things, because, chances are, that's not where your competitive advantage
lies to begin with.

That's why it's so vital that the fashion industry begin to adopt open
source. It wouldn't just help the industry and the planet, but it would free
businesses from the shackles of vendor lock-in.
